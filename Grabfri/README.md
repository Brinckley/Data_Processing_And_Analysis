# Grabfi
## Parsing friends of friends ids and building graph

First of all you need to get Auth token. You can go [here](https://vkhost.github.io/) and select **Kate Mobile** option. Check the URL for the *access_token=* field.

Create the *token.txt* file in the *Grabfri* project and paste the token there.

Put all wanted ids in the *user_ids.txt* file. You should use only numeric ids!
Install the requirements and start the program.
